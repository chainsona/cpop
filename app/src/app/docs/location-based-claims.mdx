# Location-Based POAP Claims

Location-based claims allow you to distribute POAP tokens to attendees who are physically present at a specific location. This feature is useful for events, conferences, meetups, and other gatherings where you want to verify attendee presence.

## How It Works

1. **Setup**: As an event organizer, you set up a location-based distribution method by providing:
   - A specific location (address or coordinates)
   - A claim radius (how close users need to be to claim)
   - Optional claim limits and availability dates

2. **Verification**: When attendees try to claim, the system:
   - Gets their current GPS coordinates (with permission)
   - Compares their location to the event location
   - Verifies they are within the specified radius
   - Allows claiming only if all checks pass

3. **Security**: The system includes safeguards:
   - Coordinates must be accurate within 10 seconds (to prevent location spoofing)
   - Each wallet can only claim once
   - Optional maximum claim limits
   - Time-based availability windows

## Setting Up Location-Based Claims

1. Navigate to your POAP dashboard
2. Click "Add Distribution Method"
3. Select "Location-Based"
4. Search for the event location or enter coordinates directly
5. Set the claim radius (in meters)
6. Configure additional options:
   - Maximum number of claims (or unlimited)
   - Start and end dates
7. Review and create

## Technical Details

The location verification uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between the user's location and the event location, accounting for the Earth's curvature. Coordinates are stored as floating-point numbers in the database.

```typescript
// Simplified example of the distance calculation
function calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) {
  const R = 6371e3; // Earth's radius in meters
  const φ1 = (lat1 * Math.PI) / 180;
  const φ2 = (lat2 * Math.PI) / 180;
  const Δφ = ((lat2 - lat1) * Math.PI) / 180;
  const Δλ = ((lon2 - lon1) * Math.PI) / 180;

  const a =
    Math.sin(Δφ / 2) * Math.sin(Δφ / 2) +
    Math.cos(φ1) * Math.cos(φ2) * Math.sin(Δλ / 2) * Math.sin(Δλ / 2);
  const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1 - a));

  return R * c; // distance in meters
}
```

## User Experience

Attendees will:
1. Navigate to your POAP claim page
2. Click "Get My Location" (browser will request permission)
3. Once location is captured, click "Verify Location & Claim"
4. If within the radius, the POAP will be automatically claimed
5. If outside the radius, they'll receive a notice showing how far they are from the event

## Best Practices

- **Set an appropriate radius**: 100-200 meters works well for most venues
- **Test beforehand**: Verify the location accuracy at your venue
- **Consider connectivity**: Ensure the venue has adequate internet access
- **Inform attendees**: Let them know they'll need to enable location services

## Troubleshooting

If attendees have trouble claiming:
- Ensure they have location services enabled on their device
- Ask them to refresh and try again
- Check if they're using a browser that supports geolocation
- Verify they're connected to the internet
- Consider temporarily increasing the radius if needed
